The main novelty of this paper is the use of grid computing for solving (iterative) simulation optimization problems.
The global guidance system of the search method is asked to reach and select a near-optimum solution in a relatively short time; it may have a significant improvement with computing resources that work in parallel as much as possible, by exploring larger subsets of feasible configurations of the model.
 The policy designed to arrange the exploration is a crucial part of the whole algorithm to be designed for the optimum seeking problem at hand.
Moreover, at an inner level, a specific subset of computing resources may have their own capability of:

• parallel execution of stochastic simulation;

• parallel replication of stochastic simulation to get an adequate level of statistical confidence on the performance

indices of the assigned configurations, during the (outer) optimization process.
